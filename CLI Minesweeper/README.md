# CLI Minesweeper

The classic Minesweeper game. Actually I had written programs for minesweeper a few years back as well (twice in fact!).
But in both cases I had used Visual Basic to write the code, and I had included GUI through the Visual Studio Windows Form Application feature.

This time I have written the program in C++ (a more interesting language), and it's a completely raw console application (i.e. no GUI or windows forms tools).
