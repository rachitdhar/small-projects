# Functions and File Handling

In the previous part, we have covered the logic statements that are used for python programming. Now we can learn about two more concepts that are fundamental to any programming language: Functions and File Handling.

## Functions

At the simplest level, a function is simply a block of code that you define, and then use wherever you need to use it. We use the ```def``` keyword to create a function

```py
def myfunction(): # the name of this function is "myfunction"
    '''
    Some code written
    inside this
    function
    '''
```

The program *does not* run the code inside the function on its own. A function's purpose is to only define what code it is supposed to execute *when that function gets called*. 'Calling' a function basically means 'running that function'. We call a function by using the name of that function.

```py
def print_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

print_hello()   # calling the function
                # (this will cause "Hello, world!" to be printed)
```

A function can also be defined with one or more parameters. When you want to use (i.e. 'call') this function, you must provide value(s) inside the parenthesis for the function to work with. These input values are called arguments.

```py
def print_line(sentence):       # sentence is the parameter
    print(sentence)

print_line("Hello, world!")     # "Hello, world!" is the argument
```

An example using multiple parameters:

```py
def add(num1, num2):    # num1 and num2 are 'parameters'
    print(num1 + num2)

add(3, 7)               # Here, 3 and 7 are 'arguments'
                        # The output is: 10
```

One of the most important features of a function is the ability to not only execute a block of code, but to also return some output to the program itself, when it is executed. A function can return values to the program using the ```return``` keyword.

```py
def multiply(num1, num2):
    return (num1 * num2)

product = multiply(3, 8)    # the function calculates 3 * 8, and returns 24
                            # which is then stored in the variable 'product'
```

Another example of using 'return':

```py
def vote_eligibility(age):

    if age >= 18:
        return "You can vote!"
    else:
        return "Sorry, you cannot vote!"

user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(vote_eligibility(user_age))       # the function returns the appropriate string
                                        # and that string is then printed by the print() function
```

In programming, there is a very popular concept related to functions, called *Recursion*. As the name may suggest, it involves using the function within itself! Often this is a very powerful technique indeed:

```py
# A function to calculate the factorial of a number

def factorial(n):

    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (n * factorial(n-1))
```

There is another capability that python provides, which is not so commonly used, but may be suitable in rare circumstances. It is the usage of **Nested Functions**. These are usually only used when you want to divide a complex task into several subtasks where those individual subtasks have no meaning outside the main function. Lexically, nested functions are a form of Information hiding.

```py
# function that sorts a list of numbers that the user enters
def sort_nums():

    # embedded function within original function
    def get_nums():

        nums = list()

        while True:
            while True:
                try:
                    num = int(input("Enter number: "))
                    nums += [num]
                    break
                except:
                    print("Invalid input! Try again")
            
            check = True

            while True:
                more_nums = input("Do you want to enter another number? (y/n): ")
                
                if more_nums.lower() == "y":
                    check = True
                    break
                elif more_nums.lower() == "n":
                    check = False
                    break
                else:
                    print("Invalid input! Try again")
            
            if check == False:
                break
        
        return nums


    # now working within the original function again
    nums = get_nums()
    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:
                nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]

    print(nums)
```

Python also provides a unique feature called *Lambda Functions*. These are anonymous single-line functions, used mostly for small things that are required only for a short period of time.

```py
x = lambda a : a + 10       # 'a' is the parameter for this lambda function
                            # and the value of the function is returned and stored into x.
print(x(2))     # prints 12

y = lambda a,b,c : (a * b * c)
print(y(1,2,8)) # prints 16
```

## Local and Global Scope

When you create a variable outside of any function, then that variable is going to persist throughout the rest of the program, and most importantly, *it can be accessed anywhere in the entire program*. Such a variable is called a **Global scope variable**.

However, if you create a variable *within a function*, then that variable only exists during the execution of that function's code (which happens when that function gets called). Most importantly, *you cannot access this variable from anywhere outside that function*. It can only be accessed from within that function. Such a variable is called a **Local scope variable**.

```py
list_of_names = list() # list_of_names is Global scope

def add_names():

    num = int(input("How many names do you want to enter: ")) # num is Local scope

    for i in range(num):
        name = input("Enter name: ")
        list_of_names += [name]

add_names()
```

Even in general, if your variable has been defined inside *any indented block*, it cannot be accessed from outside that indented block.

```py
for i in range(3):
    name = input("Enter name: ")    # name is Local scope. 
                                    # It cannot be accessed outside this 'for loop'
    print(f"Hello {name}!\n")
```

## File Handling

Just like ```int(), str(), list()``` etc., there is another kind of object in python, called a file. Files are important in several ways. One major use of files is as an *external storage*, which would allow you to store data related to your program within the computer memory permanently. You can then retrieve this data when your program runs the next time. In this way, you can build programs that *don't need to start from scratch each time you run them*. You can create a file variable using the ```open()``` function. The open() function is used to open a new file (i.e. in other words, create it, and then open it) or open an existing file. To open an existing file for reading purposes:

```py
my_file = open("some_file.txt", "r")
```

The first argument is either the path to the file, or directly the name of the file ONLY in case if it lies in the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY. The second argument tells the mode in which to open the file. You can find the current working directory using the following code:

```py
import os
print(os.getcwd()) # cwd : current working directory
```

Some of the standard modes in which files can be opened in python are:

| Mode | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| r | To read the existing file |
| w | To open a new/existing file for writing purpose |
| a | To open a new/existing file for appending data |
| w+ | Both write and read |
| r+ | Both read and write |
| rb | To read a binary file |
| wb | To open a new/existing binary file for writing purpose |
| rb+ | To both read and write a binary file |
| wb+ | To both write and read a binary file |

We use ```.write()``` and ```.read()``` methods to write to and read from a file respectively. There are several other methods as well, to work with files in python. After a file has been used, you must close it using the ```.close()``` method.

```py
# write data to a file
f = open("some_file.txt", "w")

data = "some data can be written here\n"\
        "for entering into the file"

f.write(data)
f.close()

# read data from a file
f = open("random_file.txt", "r")

data_retrieved = f.read()
f.close()

print(data) # to display data stored in the file
```

Python also has a special module called ```pickle```, to work on Binary files.

```py
import pickle

d = {1:"apple", 2:"banana"}
f = open("some_file.txt", "wb")

pickle.dump(d, f) # to store the dictionary in the file
f.close()

f = open("some_file.txt", "rb")
dict_retrieved = pickle.load(f) # retrieves the dictionary and stores it
                                # and stores it in the variable dict_retrieved
                                # (pickle.load() gets only the latest thing that was 'dumped')
f.close()
```

Say if you dumped 3 objects: obj1, obj2, and obj3, one at a time (i.e. you called .dump() method 3 separate times). Now, if you use .load(), you will first get obj3. Then if you call it again, you'll get obj2, and next obj1.

A more convenient (and somewhat 'safer') way to use a file, is through the ```with``` keyword. This ensures that all code related to the handling of the opened file remains within the "with"-block of code. After the 'with'-block is over, the file is automatically closed by the python interpreter, so there's no need for explicitly closing the file (hence, making it a 'safer' way of opening files).

```py
with open("some_random_file.txt", "w") as f:
    # your code

# you cannot use the file outside
# the 'with'-block since it gets closed
# when you come out of the block
```
