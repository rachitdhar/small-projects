# Program Logic

Now that we have covered the basics in parts 1 and 2, we will study the actual implementation of logic in python programming, using which we can create algorithms to solve problems. After that, we will briefly cover Error handling in python as well. The topics to be covered are:

1. Decision making
2. For Loop
3. While Loop
4. Jump Statements
4. Error Handling
